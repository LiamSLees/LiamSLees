Hello everyone, I am Liam Lees
I am currently a student at San Diego State University looking to publish personal projects for everyone to see! I am looking for a job and would like to publish my work
to offer potential employers a window into my creative workflow. Projects are sorted into my folder titled "Resume Review:", Thanks for your consideration and I'll continue
to upload projects as I create more!
